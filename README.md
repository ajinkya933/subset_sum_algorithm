# subset_sum_algorithm
This is implemention of one of the most important algorithms in Java called subset sum algorithm
Subset sum algorithm is: In computer science, the subset sum problem is an important problem in complexity 
theory and cryptography. The problem is this: given a set (or multiset) of integers, is there a non-empty 
subset whose sum is zero? For example, given the set {−7, −3, −2, 5, 8}, the answer is yes because the 
subset {−3, −2, 5} sums to zero. The problem is NP-complete.
